<h1>Exercise</h1>
<details>
<summary>Exercise</summary>
<p> Exercise is movement for the body and mind. Exercise is important to keep our heart and bodies healthy.  
<summary> Typically, I exercise 5 days a week 1 hour a day. I focus on 30 minutes of cardio and 20 minutes of strength training. I find that moving my body helps me focus and gives me energy to be the best wife, mother, teacher that I can be.

<h1> Cooking </h1>
<details>
<summary> Cooking </summary>
<p> Cooking is good for the soul. Not matter what you cook in the kitchen it slows you down and helps you process what you are doing. I enjoy cooking for my family and turning on my amazon Alexa and listening to music. I cook a variety of different meals for
my family. Specifically mexican style, chicken pasta meals, baseball nights crock pot meals, pot roast, sunday dinner is one of my favorite meals to cook. I recently started baking cakes. My favorite two cakes to make are blueberry 
with creamcheese icing and keylime cake. A fun fact about me. I clean my kitchen while I cook so I don't have a pile of dirty dishes at the end.

<h1> Quality Family Time </h1>
<details>
<summary>Spending time with family </summary>
<p> My three boys are my world. I have learned over the years that I have to find things that make me happy so of course I enjoy shopping. What women doesn't enjoy shopping! When I am not busy, I find myself at the ballpark with my 5 year old or 13 year old. 
If we aren't playing baseball we are in the woods fishing with their Dad. We love making memories as a family because life is too short. You must love on each other and be thankful for Gods blessings.        </p>
